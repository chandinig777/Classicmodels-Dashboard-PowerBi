💼 Employee Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting employee salaries based on various business and performance-related features using multiple regression algorithms. By leveraging machine learning models like Linear Regression, Ridge, Random Forest, and XGBoost, the goal is to accurately estimate salaries based on patterns in historical employee data.

🔍 Project Objective
To build a predictive model that can estimate employee salary based on factors such as:

Total Sales

Bonus

Base Pay

Unit Price

Calls handled

Months of service

Rating, Education, Gender, Business Unit, and other features

⚙️ Tools & Techniques
Python: Core programming

Pandas, NumPy: Data preprocessing and wrangling

Scikit-learn: ML models, evaluation metrics

XGBoost, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree: Model training

Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization

SHAP: Feature importance explanation

Statistical Tests: ANOVA, t-test, correlation analysis

📈 Key Results
Achieved ~99% R² score using Random Forest and XGBoost

Identified Bonus, Total Sales, and Base Pay as top predictors of salary

Outlier handling with Winsorization and feature scaling applied

Model performance evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and MSE
